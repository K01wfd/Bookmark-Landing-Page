## My process

- Mobile-first process, used custom css properties to dynamically change the font sizes, clrs, etc...!
- Used Javascript to create interactive navigation bar, my solution maynot be perfect but i think it's working, at least i gave it a try ðŸ™‚.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- Creating responsive and iteractive navigation bar, which was bit complicated.
- Creating the Accordion component.

### Continued development

- as usual, keep learning, and staying on the track with latest updates is the key.
